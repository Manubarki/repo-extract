# Repo Extract

Search GitHub repos · Extract contributors · Enrich profiles · Export CSV

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Open the App
Visit the live app at [manubarki.site](https://manubarki.site).

### 2. (Optional) Add a GitHub Token
Click the **key icon** next to the search bar and paste a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens).  
This increases your API rate limit from 10 → 30 requests/min and unlocks private repo access.

### 3. Search for a Repository
Type a repo name, keyword, or owner (e.g. `facebook/react`) into the search bar and press **Search**.  
Results are sorted by stars. Use the pagination controls to browse through them.

### 4. Select a Repository
Click on any repo card from the search results. A dialog will open showing the repo details.

### 5. Extract Contributors
Click **Extract Contributors** in the dialog. The tool will fetch all contributors (up to 2,000) with progress updates.

### 6. Enrich Profiles
Click **Enrich Profiles** to pull additional data for each contributor:
- Full name, bio, company, location
- Email, Twitter, blog, social links

A progress bar shows enrichment status. You can **pause/resume** at any time.

### 7. Find Emails (Bulk)
Click **Find All Emails** to search for emails of contributors who don't have one listed publicly.  
This uses commit data and event history to discover emails.

### 8. Filter by Location
Use the **location filter** input to narrow down contributors by their location field (e.g. "San Francisco", "India").

### 9. Export to CSV
Click **Export CSV** to download the full contributor list as a `.csv` file with all enriched data.
